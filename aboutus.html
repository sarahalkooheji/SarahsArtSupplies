                  <p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation
                      process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout
                      the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end
                      user.
                    </p>

                    <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
                      communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
                      according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
                      with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
